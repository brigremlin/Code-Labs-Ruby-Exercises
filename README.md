Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em>An ideology used in object-oriented programming languages that deals with hiding certain details surrounding functionality in code. Abstraction provides developers the ability to utilize code and/or processes without always having access to every part of codes details. An example of this in object-oriented programming is libraries. <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - Data types are types or categories of data in a programming language. Data types in general are commonly known as numbers and text. In Ruby, data types include strings, integers, floats, symbols, booleans. <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - Variables are pieces of data that are used to store a value. It is also known as a memory location where the value is held. The value stored can be referened and changed on command. <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - A local variable is a variable declared inside of a function or method. It is only accessible within that function or method. A global variable is a variable that can be accessed throughout the program. A constant variable is a value that cannot be reassigned. Unlike local variables and global variables, the value of a constant variable cannot be changed. <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - Scope is how and where a variable can be accessed. <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - A constant variable is a value that cannot be reassigned. Unlike local variables and global variables, the value of a constant variable cannot be changed. <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - In object-oriented programming, a method is a defined process or procedure associated with a class. It is a block of code that performs a task. In best programming practices, each method or function should only have one task to complete. <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - IRB stands for Interactive Ruby and is a way to run Ruby code without creating a Ruby file. It can be thought of as a Ruby simulator. <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - An operator tells the compiler which mathematical, logical, or relational operation to perform. <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. Classes contain methods and attributes that help define the object's characteristics. <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - Gems in Ruby are packages of code/ libraries. It's similar to extentions or add-ons in programs. <br>
